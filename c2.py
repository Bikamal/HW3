# Write a class called Product. 
# The class should have Ô¨Åelds called name, amount, and price.
#  There should be a method get_price that receives the number of items to be bought and returns
#  a the cost of buying that many items, where the regular price is charged for orders of less than 10 items,
#  a 10% discount is applied for orders of between 10 and 99 items, and a 20% discount is applied for orders of 
# 100 or more items. There should also be a method called make_purchase that receives the number of items to be
#  bought and decreases amount by that much.
